# Credit-Score-Classification

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:
- Good
- Standard
- Poor

A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. I found an ideal dataset for this task of training a "credit score classification model" from Kaggle.

Key Findings from the dataset for proceeding with the machine learning model:
- There’s not much difference in the credit scores of all occupations mentioned in the data.
- If more you earn more annually, your credit score would be better.
- The more monthly in-hand salary you earn, the better your credit score will become.
- Having more bank accounts (>3) doesn’t positively impact credit scores.
- Having more credit cards (>5) will not positively impact your credit scores.
- Having an average interest rate of more than 15% is bad for your credit scores.
- Having more than three loans at a time will negatively impact your credit scores.
- Delaying your payments for more than 17 days from the due date will impact your credit scores negatively.
-  Delaying more than 12 payments from the due date will affect your credit scores negatively.
-  Having a debt of more than $1338 will affect your credit scores negatively.
-  Credit utilization ratio doesn’t affect your credit scores.
-  Having a long credit history results in better credit scores.
-  The number of EMIs you are paying in a month doesn’t affect much on credit scores.
-  The amount of money you invest monthly doesn’t affect your credit scores a lot.
-  Having a high monthly balance in your account at the end of the month is good for your credit scores.
-  The credit mix feature tells about the types of credits and loans you have taken.

Steps to run the model:
- Download the zip file and extract on your system.
- You will find both dataset file and ipynb file, save them in the same folder before running the code file.
