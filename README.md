# Credit-Score-Classification

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:
Good
Standard
Poor

A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. I found an ideal dataset for this task of training a "credit score classification model" from Kaggle.
